**Key Features:**

**Advanced Monitoring:** Monitors critical parameters like temperature, humidity, pressure, and particle count using MEMS-based sensors to maintain an optimized production environment.

**Real-Time Data:** Transmits sensor data to a central hub (Raspberry Pi) via BLE, which then uploads it to the cloud for analysis and visualization.

**Cost-Effective:**  Utilizes cost-effective MEMS sensors to replace conventional analog sensors, reducing operational costs.

**Cloud Integration:**  Integrates with GEâ€™s digital tools to track and trend vital signs from manufacturing equipment, enhancing productivity and reducing downtime.

This project demonstrates the practical application of IIoT in manufacturing, providing a robust solution to enhance efficiency and reduce costs.
