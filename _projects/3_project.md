**Key Features:**

**Efficient ASR Technology:** Utilizes Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) for feature extraction and HMM training to ensure high performance with low computational overhead.

**Real-Time Processing:** Capable of real-time speech detection and recognition, continuously monitoring audio input and providing immediate responses.

**Robust Performance:**  Demonstrates low Word Error Rates (WER) across various utterances and acoustic conditions.

**Resources:**
**Code:** [GitHub](https://github.com/deekshaprabhu7/Odessa)
