In 2014, our team of three designed an Intel Galileo-based amphibious vehicle capable of performing rescue and surveillance operations in disaster-affected and inaccessible regions. This innovative hovercraft can be remotely controlled and is equipped with an array of environmental sensors and a live video streaming system, enabling real-time data collection and situational awareness.

Key Features:

Versatility: Operates efficiently on both land and water, assisting in diverse rescue missions.
Advanced Sensors: Equipped with cameras, IR sensors, ultrasonic sensors, environmental sensors and sound sensors to detect and relay crucial information.

Live Monitoring: Capable of silent entry into hazardous areas for enemy monitoring and reconnaissance.

Recognition: Awarded the Best Project at the Intel India Embedded Challenge 2014 in the category of Internet of Things and Intelligent Systems.

This hovercraft significantly enhances the capabilities of rescue teams by providing critical data on the number of casualties, hazardous conditions, and survivors in real-time, thus improving the efficiency and safety of rescue operations.
