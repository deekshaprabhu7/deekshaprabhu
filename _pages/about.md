I am a first year Master's student in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department at the University of Washington, advised by [Professor Vikram Iyer](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~vsiyer/) at the Ubiquitous Computing Lab. I earned my undergraduate degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Manipal Institute of Technology, India, specializing in Embedded Systems.

Before joining UW, I spent five years at GE Healthcare as a Senior Software Engineer, where I focused on developing firmware for medical diagnostic equipment. My professional experience has equipped me with a strong foundation in software engineering and a deep understanding of embedded systems, which I am now applying to my graduate studies.
