I am a Masterâ€™s student in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department at the University of Washington, where I am advised by [Dr. Vikram Iyer](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~vsiyer/) in the Iyer Lab. My research interests lie in designing low-power, scalable systems at the intersection of ubiquitous computing and human-centered technologies, with applications in health sensing and societal well-being.

I hold a bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from the Manipal Institute of Technology, India, where I specialized in Embedded Systems. Prior to my graduate studies, I spent five years at GE Healthcare as a Senior Software Engineer, developing firmware for medical diagnostic equipment. These experiences equipped me with a strong foundation in embedded systems, real-time control algorithms, and energy-efficient system design, which now guide my academic and research endeavors.
